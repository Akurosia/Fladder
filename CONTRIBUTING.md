## How to Contribute
Interest in contributing? Here are a couple of ways you can help:

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs
- Before reporting a bug, **please ensure** that the issue hasn't been reported already.
- When submitting a bug report, provide detailed steps on how the bug can be reproduced. This will help us to understand and fix the issue faster.
- Bug reports are appreciated and very helpful!

### 🚀 Submitting Pull Requests
- **Pull requests are always welcome!** 
- For new features or large changes, please open a discussion or issue first to ensure that no one else is already working on it.
- **Keep pull requests short and focused**: try to avoid fixing multiple issues in a single pull request. This helps make the review process smoother and quicker.
